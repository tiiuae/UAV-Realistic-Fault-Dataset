# UAV-Realistic-Fault-Dataset

This data set is released with the publication  **Towards a Reliable and Lightweight Onboard Fault Detection in
Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles**, which is accepted at [ICRA 2023](https://www.icra2023.org/).

Propeller are an important subsystem of a UAV (also known as a drone). Accelerometer, Gyroscope, and Audio data can be used to detect propeller damage, which improves the resilience and safety of the UAV system.

The data set consists of in-door missions, which were captured from take-off to landing. The number of broken propellers is varied from 0 to 4, both inclusive.

## Details of the Data Set
The data is divided into 5 classes - 0-Normal, 1-Broken, 2-Broken, 3-Broken, 4-Broken Propellers. Each class directory contains sub-directory for each mission.
